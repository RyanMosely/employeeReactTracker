## Conclusion

This project was a good starting point for me to understand how react files are structured, how the state relates to the rest of the components, and how methods can be utilized to help dynamically update the react page. Since front-end programming is what I am the most interested in at the moment regarding developing, I found alot of excitement learning/doing extra research to figure out how the application works as a whole. The main thing that I learned in the process is how modularized everything is in a react app; it took me a while to see how things are connected in the application. Though I am excited to implement react into future projects, I am even more eager to learn more about how this application works and to find more efficient ways to program within react.
